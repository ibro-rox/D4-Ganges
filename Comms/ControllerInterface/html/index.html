 <h2><a class="anchor" id="intro_sec">
Introduction</a></h2>
<p>rfm12lib is an open source library for Atmel AVR microcontrollers that allows you to hook up RF12 modules (<a href="http://www.hoperf.com/pro/RFM12.html">RFM12</a>) from <a href="http://www.hoperf.com/">HopeRF</a> to your microcontroller and add wireless functionaility to your project. It is written in C and requires the free AVR-GCC compiler. The library supports modules of all frequency bands.</p>
<p>This documentation will give you a short overview on how to connect and operate the RF12 modules. It assumes that you have some prior knowledge of C programming. However, no special knowledge about the modules or wireless communication is necessary, unless you want to hack the library itself. The documentation only covers the user API, but excludes library internals. If you wish to extend the library, please have a look at the source code itself, as it claims to be commented quite thoroughly.</p>
<p>Got the library but no modules yet?<br/>
 There are several suppliers of the RFM12. If you happen to live in germany and need low quantities, you could have a look at the <a href="http://www.pollin.de/">pollin online store</a>, which sells them but tends to be expensive. If you need quantities above 10 modules, you are advised to contact the manufacturer directly, as they might be cheaper overall (including shipping). Otherwise, Google is your friend.</p>
<p>The library and all its sources are licensed under the terms of the GPL version 2 or later.</p>
<p>The project page of this library might contain some additional information, as well as the <b>download links</b>. <br/>
 It is located here: <a href="http://www.das-labor.org/wiki/RFM12_library/en"><b>http://www.das-labor.org/wiki/RFM12_library/en</b></a> (also available in <a href="http://www.das-labor.org/wiki/RFM12_library"><b>German</b></a>).</p>
<p>If you have any comments, suggestions or bug reports, please don't hesitate to contact us via <b>info &lt;&Auml;T&gt; das-labor.org</b> . <br/>
 We're also happy to receive patches, given the case you already modified the library and added or changed some meaningful stuff.</p>

<p><a class="el" href="extra_features.html">This page</a> has a more in-depth explanation and usage description of the extra features.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="getstarted_sec">
Getting Started</a></h2>
<p>Although it is recommended to have a look at the documentation first, you could also just begin to use the library.</p>
<p>You will have to connect the module to your AVR microcontroller. The section <a class="el" href="index.html#hard_sec">hardware</a> explains how to connect the module. Otherwise it's enough to just solder the SPI port pins appropriately to the hardware SPI port of your AVR and connect the slave select pin anywhere. In case you are using software SPI, you are free to solder the SPI connections to any port pin of the AVR and define the connections in software. Be sure to add an antenna to your module. Usually a short strip of wire is enough. If you want to have a nicely resonating antenna, use an online calculator to get the right length for a whip (1/4 wave) antenna. The optimal length for 433MHz is about 17,5cm or 7 inches. However, any shorter strip of wire usually suffices.</p>
<p>Next you will have to download the library (if you haven't done so yet) and place it somewhere next to your source folder.</p>
<p>In order to run, the library will need some configuration, which is stored in a header file usually named rfm12_config.h. See the section <a class="el" href="index.html#conf_sec">Configuration</a> for more information on how to configure the library. Otherwise just take the demo configuration header from the library folder, put into your source folder and change the values to your needs. The library itself will not include the configuration file, you have to do this manually before including the <a class="el" href="rfm12_8h.html" title="rfm12 library main header">rfm12.h</a> header. However, the <a class="el" href="rfm12_8c.html" title="rfm12 library main file">rfm12.c</a> file will need a special wrapper.</p>
<p>To use the library with your project, it's advised to create two wrapper files, which will simplify your makefile and include the library configuration. Just create two files, <b>rfm12.c</b> and <b>rfm12.h</b> inside your source folder and include the RFM12 configuration header (usually rfm12_config.h), as well as the real <a class="el" href="rfm12_8c.html" title="rfm12 library main file">rfm12.c</a> and <a class="el" href="rfm12_8h.html" title="rfm12 library main header">rfm12.h</a>. <br/>
 Here's an example:</p>
<p><b>rfm12.h</b> </p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment"><span class="preprocessor"> #include &quot;rfm12_config.h&quot;</span>
<span class="preprocessor"> #include &quot;../rfm12lib/rfm12.h&quot;</span>
</pre></div><p><b>rfm12.c</b> </p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment"><span class="preprocessor"> #include &quot;rfm12_config.h&quot;</span>
<span class="preprocessor"> #include &quot;../rfm12lib/rfm12.c&quot;</span>
</pre></div><p>This way the configuration is correctly supplied to the library and you will only need to add <a class="el" href="rfm12_8c.html" title="rfm12 library main file">rfm12.c</a> to your makefile or project to compile the library.</p>
<p>Finally, you just need to include your <b>rfm12.h</b> to use the library!</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="use_sec">
Using the Library</a></h2>
<p>Using the library to transmit or receive data packets turns out to be incredibly simple. <br/>
 Just do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>At the beginning of your application, call <a class="el" href="rfm12_8c.html#a435d3650bfc7c165fb430a8d4527ef7b" title="This is the main library initialization function.">rfm12_init()</a> once to initialize the module</li>
<li>Call <a class="el" href="rfm12_8c.html#ae928504f5cf2cbe4f894affc4faa2398" title="The tick function implements collision avoidance and initiates transmissions.">rfm12_tick()</a> periodically, as it will maintain the collision avoidance and start transferring your enqueued packets</li>
<li>Use the <a class="el" href="rfm12_8c.html#a6e9c9b38d4436b312818b8544d6d19bd" title="Copy a packet to the buffer and call rfm12_start_tx() to enqueue it for transmission...">rfm12_tx()</a> function to enqueue a packet for transmission</li>
<li>Check if a packet has been received via <a class="el" href="rfm12_8h.html#ac5f459ab0857af6cd3651d03b1f0d201" title="Inline function to return the rx buffer status byte.">rfm12_rx_status()</a></li>
<li>Read packet length, type and contents using <a class="el" href="rfm12_8h.html#a118185e669a176439c45420f68967b84" title="Inline function to return the rx buffer length field.">rfm12_rx_len()</a>, <a class="el" href="rfm12_8h.html#ab1e11af920e7f39c601bd42912debb5b" title="Inline function to return the rx buffer type field.">rfm12_rx_type()</a>, <a class="el" href="rfm12_8h.html#a0ffa5a87f37bbc2af40850ce265da99b" title="Inline function to retreive current rf buffer contents.">rfm12_rx_buffer()</a></li>
<li>Be sure to clear the received packet buffer after reading a packet by calling <a class="el" href="rfm12_8c.html#adf41f135b72ab0966e5cc43d20d9d864" title="Function to clear buffer complete/occupied status.">rfm12_rx_clear()</a></li>
<li>If you are using polling instead of the interrupt, you have to call rfm12_poll() periodically to transmit and receive packets. <br/>
 rfm12_poll() has to be called a lot more often than <a class="el" href="rfm12_8c.html#ae928504f5cf2cbe4f894affc4faa2398" title="The tick function implements collision avoidance and initiates transmissions.">rfm12_tick()</a>, as it needs to fill or read the 1-byte FIFO of the RFM12 for every byte in a transmission.</li>
</ul>
<p>Click the function name links to get to the documentation.</p>
<p>A simple main method to transmit some packets merely consists of the following: </p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment"> uint8_t teststring[] = <span class="stringliteral">&quot;teststring\r\n&quot;</span>;
 uint8_t packettype = 0xEE;
 <a class="code" href="rfm12_8c.html#a435d3650bfc7c165fb430a8d4527ef7b" title="This is the main library initialization function.">rfm12_init</a>();  <span class="comment">/* initialize the library */</span>
 sei();
 
 <span class="keywordflow">while</span> (23)
 {
   <span class="comment">/* ... */</span>
   <a class="code" href="rfm12_8c.html#a6e9c9b38d4436b312818b8544d6d19bd" title="Copy a packet to the buffer and call rfm12_start_tx() to enqueue it for transmission...">rfm12_tx</a> (<span class="keyword">sizeof</span>(teststring), packettype, teststring);
   <a class="code" href="rfm12_8c.html#ae928504f5cf2cbe4f894affc4faa2398" title="The tick function implements collision avoidance and initiates transmissions.">rfm12_tick</a>();  <span class="comment">/* periodic tick function - call that one once in a while */</span>
 }
</pre></div><p>There are several extra features. They are explained <a class="el" href="extra_features.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Some example projects for an ATmega8 can be found in the subdirectory <b>test-m8</b>.</p>

 Please note that the buffers will consume ram, so be careful when making them larger. <br/>
 If you set all buffers to 255 bytes, which is the maximum packet size, then you will consume 3 * 255 bytes of ram.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="conf_int_sec">
Interrupt Configuration</a></h3>
<p>The RFM12 may use an interrupt to signal various events to the microcontroller. As this library utilizes the interrupt, you must configure the right interrupt for your AVR device. Please refer to your specific AVR datasheet for more information on the external interrupts. The interrupt has to be an external interrupt pin, triggering on a negative edge.</p>

<span class="preprocessor"> #define RFM12_LOW_POWER 0 </span>
</pre></div><p>Set <b>RFM12_LIVECTRL</b> to 1 to enable a set of functions which allow runtime reconfiguration of the frequency and baud rate. They are disabled by default to reduce the size of the binary. See <a class="el" href="rfm12__ctrl_8h.html" title="rfm12 library live control feature header">rfm12_ctrl.h</a> for the functions.</p>
<p>Set <b>RFM12_NORETURNS</b> to 1 to disable the return values of the transmit functions. This saves some bytes (although very few) in the binary.</p>
<p>Set <b>RFM12_NOCOLLISIONDETECTION</b> to 1 to disable the collision avoidance. This will speed up <a class="el" href="rfm12_8c.html#ae928504f5cf2cbe4f894affc4faa2398" title="The tick function implements collision avoidance and initiates transmissions.">rfm12_tick()</a> and save a consideable amount of bytes in the binary. When using transmit only mode, collision avoidance will be disabled anyway, as the receiver is not available then.</p>
<p>Set <b>RFM12_TRANSMIT_ONLY</b> to 1 if you do not need to receive data. This will strip the receiving functionaility of the library completely, reducing the resulting binary size by a considerable amount of bytes. As the receiver is not available to check for active transmissions from other transmitters on the selected frequency, collision avoidance would not work and is disabled in this case.</p>
<p>Set <b>RFM12_SPI_SOFTWARE</b> to 1 if you wish to use software SPI instead of hardware SPI.</p>
<p>Set <b>RFM12_USE_POLLING</b> to 1 in case you do not want to use an interrupt for packet handling. This will enable a function named rfm12_poll() which has to be called periodically to handle packet transfers. rfm12_poll() has to be called a lot more often than <a class="el" href="rfm12_8c.html#ae928504f5cf2cbe4f894affc4faa2398" title="The tick function implements collision avoidance and initiates transmissions.">rfm12_tick()</a>, as it needs to fill or read the 1-byte FIFO of the RFM12 for every byte in a transmission.</p>
<p>Set <b>RFM12_RECEIVE_ASK</b> to 1 if you intend to receive ASK (amplitude shift keying) modulated data. Usually this module cannot do that, but with some soldering and an extra ADC interrupt, you still can receive data from simple devices such as thermometers or wireless outlets, which tend to use ASK. Note that this feature will use the ADC interrupt of your AVR. See <a class="el" href="rfm12__extra_8h.html" title="rfm12 library extra features header">rfm12_extra.h</a> for the functions.</p>
<p>Set <b>RFM12_TRANSMIT_ASK</b> to 1 if you also want to send ASK modulated data. This will provide you with a set of functions to switch into ASK transmit mode and to enable or disable the transceiver. Obviously this is a hack. You can emaulate ASK modulated signals with this, by turning on and off the transmitter, which translates into some amplitude (1) or no amplitude (0). Unfortunately you have to do the proper bit timing and transmit function yourself. See <a class="el" href="rfm12__extra_8h.html" title="rfm12 library extra features header">rfm12_extra.h</a> for the functions.</p>
<p>Set <b>RFM12_USE_WAKEUP_TIMER</b> to 1 to use the wakeup timer feature of the RFM12. When enabling this, there will be a function to set the wakeup timer, and the interrupt will handle wakeup events. You can use this to put your AVR into sleep mode and let him wake up periodically. This way you can save huge amounts of power and run your application off of goldcaps for some time or increase battery life. Sometimes the wakeup timer feature works unstable and requires fine tuning of your application. See <a class="el" href="extra_features.html">Extra Features</a> for more help on this topic. <a class="el" href="rfm12__extra_8h.html" title="rfm12 library extra features header">rfm12_extra.h</a> contains the functions.</p>
<p>Set <b>RFM12_LOW_POWER</b> to 1 to use the low-battery detector feature of the RFM12. If this feature is enabled, the interrupt will recognize a low battery voltage alert from the RFM12. There are functions in <a class="el" href="rfm12__extra_8h.html" title="rfm12 library extra features header">rfm12_extra.h</a> to set the specific warning voltage and to read the current battery status.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="tech_sec">
Technical Details</a></h2>
<p>The library utilizes the digital SPI interface of the module for communication. The RFM12 is operated in FIFO mode in conjunction with an interrupt output to signal various operating states to the microcontroller. Additional module configuration includes automatic frequency correction in receive mode, as well as sync pattern detection. The sync pattern detection feature of the RFM12 starts filling the receive FIFO only when a predefined synchronization pattern has been received. The specific pattern is prepended automatically to every packet before transmission by the library.</p>
<p>The library implements a basic packet format with a one byte type or address field, a one byte length field and a simple crc check over the header. As the RFM12 only has a 1-byte FIFO, all packet data transfers from and to the device are encapsulated by an interrupt and several API functions. Due to this encapsulation, packet header crc values can be generated and verified automatically. Invalid packets are silently dropped without user notice.</p>
<p>To minimize erroneous packet transfers, a simple collision avoidance algorithm has been implemented. All packet transfers are enqueued into an internal buffer before transmission. A periodically called function (<a class="el" href="rfm12_8c.html#ae928504f5cf2cbe4f894affc4faa2398" title="The tick function implements collision avoidance and initiates transmissions.">rfm12_tick()</a>) measures if a carrier signal is present, and if so, inhibits further packet transfers for a settable time. If the selected frequency is free long enough, an enqueud packet transfer will be started by <a class="el" href="rfm12_8c.html#ae928504f5cf2cbe4f894affc4faa2398" title="The tick function implements collision avoidance and initiates transmissions.">rfm12_tick()</a>.</p>
<p>The interrupt handles FIFO over- and underflow, low-battery detection and wakeup timer events. If a FIFO interrupt occurs, the current operating state is determined (receiving or transmitting) and the next byte is either read or written to or from the FIFO.</p>
