25/02/17 15:00-15:35 All present (Joe, Ben, Mohammed, Lawrence, Joel)
Agenda
-----------
Discuss and assign subsystem roles.

Assign admin roles.

Discuss:
	- For the human controller will we use the Spektrum or our own?
	- Chassis - Acrylic, aluminium or MDF?
	- Extra features?
Plan for Monday:
	- 150 word abstract
	- High level block diagram

Minutes
---------
Roles:
	- Communications:	Ground to air - Joel
				Air to ground - Mohammed
				Controller - Mohammed
	- Control:		Gyro/accelerometer interface - Joe
				PID Controller - Lawrence
				IR sensors - Ben
	- Chassis		Overall design - Joel & Lawrence
				Cargo acquisition mechanism - Joe
	- Power Management - Ben
	- Integration - Ben
	- File logging - Mohammed
	- Soldering - Mohammed

Admin roles:
	- Leader/Administrator - Ben
	- Treasurer - Lawrence
	- Communications officer - Joe
	- Secretary - Joel
	- Documenter - Mohammed

Decided to:
	- Use our own controller.
	- Laser-cut acrylic chassis.
	- Extra features are an IR sensor for measuring height, downlink communications, remotely tunable PID and security on the communications.
	- Use 3 Il Mattos

26/02/17 18:15-18:45 All present (Joe, Ben, Mohammed, Lawrence, Joel)
Agenda
-----------
What needs discussing with Tim Forcer?
What do we need to bring?
Does the abstract need editing?
Is everyone agreed on the schematic diagram?
Use Github?
How are people getting on?

Minutes
---------
Decided the specification part of the abstract could be skimmed down.
Agreed that the schematic diagram is complete.
Everyone happy to use Github.
Decided to use 2 transceivers on each end (i.e. two slaves connected to both Il Mattos). Extra slave of the SD card on the drone.

27/02/17 10:10-10:25 All present (Joe, Ben, Mohammed, Lawrence, Joel)
Agenda
-----------
What needs discussing at the clinic?
Does the abstract need more editing?

Minutes
---------
To dicuss at the clinic:
	- Simulation - what are they expecting?
	- Control
	- Thoughts on components
	- Ask about marking - is more hardware design required?
	- Is the frequency band of the wireless transceivers wide enough?
Request different frequency bands for the transceivers on the requisition form.
Abstract size needs reducing further

3/03/17 11:38-11:58 All present (Joe, Ben, Mohammed, Lawrence, Joel) with Rob Maunder
Agenda
-----------
Run through the project proposal form
Any other advice from Rob?

Minutes
---------
Explained the block diagram:
	- Focus on integration of blocks
	- Explained our roles in terms of integration
	- Power for the groun Il Matto needs to be considered
	- Look at power distribution on the drone
Ensure we have distinct roles.
Risks:
	- Have we considered if the Leonardo is powerful enough?
	- Do we have enough knowledge of PID? We have found code that handles it.
Design completion milestones:
	- e.g. for comms: 1. SPI interface 2. SPI transmitting, 3. SPI receiving 4. two way
	- Rough guideline of one milestone per interface
	- Milestones for different paths through the block diagram

9/03/17 13:02-13:19 All present (Joe, Ben, Mohammed, Lawrence, Joel)
Agenda
-----------
Plan for the rest of the construction time

Minutes
---------
Work on critical path at the moment - add on extra features such as telemetry later on.
For the communications add more efficient comms scheme first then add the code to change k values remotely.
	- K values vary from 0-10.23.
Chassis is glued - can work on any other stuff that needs doing (e.g. servo mechanism).
Finalise extra features by Friday.
Checked that we will all have enough to write on the report.
Get the ESCs calibrated and get the critical path done today.

10/03/17 17:49-18:01 All present (Joe, Ben, Mohammed, Lawrence, Joel)
Agenda
-----------
Plan for the last weekend of construction

Minutes
---------
Mohammed and Joe are away - give each other our numbers to allow quick contact if required.
Joel, Lawrence and Ben will do the PID tuning over the weekend.
Bring a 12v power supply with a max current of 4/5A and a positive centre if possible.
