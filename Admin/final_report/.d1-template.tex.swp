\section{Adder design, simulation and synthesis}
If you have implemented your own code for the adder or modified the code provided, state briefly what you did and provide your code. 

\subsection{Adder simulation}
Include your testbench and a Modelsim diagram.

\section{Register design, simulation and synthesis}
If you have implemented your own code for the registers or modified the code provided, state briefly what you did and provide your code. 

\subsection{Simulation of registers}
Include your testbench and a Modelsim diagram.

\section{Sequencer design, simulation and synthesis}
Give the ASM chart of your sequencer and the code you developed. Explain your code and your testbench.  Give Modelsim results and Synplify RTL synthesis diagram (you may want to use advantage of the ‘state machine’ diagram drawing option in Synplify). 

\section{Multiplier design, simulation and synthesis}
If you have modified the code provided for the encapsulating module code, include it. In particular explain briefly how you handled the inputs M and Q.  Give Modelsim results and Synplify RTL synthesis diagram. 

\section{Extensions}
State if extensions were attempted. If yes, include your modified code and Modelsim results for the modified multiplier. State if your extensions worked correctly

\section{Conclusion}
State which objectives have been achieved. Give your general conclusion, what you learnt etc. Comment on ways to improve the design or extend it further  (max. 1/4 of a page).
\appendix
\section{References}
Quote the sources of your information. Especially make reference to any sources you used in the development of your code.
