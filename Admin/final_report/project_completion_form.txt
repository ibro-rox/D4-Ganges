Cost estimates
--------------
The final estimated costings are outlined in section 4 of the main team report.

Our estimate at the beginning of the project of the total development and manufacturing costs was £135,143.55. The actual total came to £154,679.32. This £19,535.77 difference is largely due to the man hours being significantly more than expected (700 vs 440). Development and testing was a more time-consuming task than we thought initially.

--------------
Design Changes
--------------
The design remained largely unchanged from that which was laid out in the Project Proposal Form. A couple of features, SD card logging and remote PID tuning, could not be implemented fully due to time-constraints from more critical systems.

---------------------------------
Discrepancy in Project activities
---------------------------------
Development and testing of the communications took longer than anticipated and as such the tesing of the RFM12B-S2 modules was also done on Monday. Encryption was a less time-critical feature and testing of it was done after the two-way communications was comprehensively tested.
