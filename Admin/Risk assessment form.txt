HAZARD
1.) Ground control User interface may interfere with transmission of joystick controls 
Sensitivity: 3
Likelihood : 4
Risk : 12
Control: Implement interrupts-conditional statemets methodology to prevent UI from blocking the transmission of joystick values for a significant amount of time, ensuring smooth ground control.
Controlled sensitivity: 2
Controlled Likelihood: 1
Risk: 2

2.) Mishandling of the ESC.
Sensitivity : 4
Linkeihood : 3
Risk : 12
Control: Ensure we comply with ESC's handling guidelines. Confirm correct wiring of the ESC's before applying power. Make sure each ECS is calibrated to control the motors with the given control signals.
Controlled sensitivity: 3
Controlled Likelihood: 2
Risk: 6

3.) Lack of protection from propellers
Sensitvity: 3
Likelihood :5
Risk: 15
Control: make sure that the motors are not running when a team member is close to them. Considerations are made to the chassis design to include blade guards.
Controlled Sensitvity : 2
Controlled Likelihood : 2
Controlled Risk: 4

4.) Improper use of the battery
Sensitivity: 4
Likelihood : 3
Risk : 12
Control : Read the online resources and spec sheets to properly utilise the battery to deliver the adequate power needed to run all four motors. Ensure the battery is charged for an adequate amount of time.
Also use any relevant measurement tools (eg. multimeters) for checking the voltages and currents between the supply to the ESCs to the Motors.
Controlled Sensitivity: 2
Controlled Likelihood: 2
Controlled Risk: 4

5.) Losing wireless communications from the Human operator.
Sensitivity: 4
Likelihood: 4
Risk: 16
Control : Need to implement a solution for countering the problem of receiving data from other other transmitters operating in the same channel/ band.
In terms of other drones receiving our transmitted data we are considering the implementation of identification in the transmitted packet so that the data received by other drones becomes redundant. More immportantly if, due to technical issues with the transceiver modules, the communication link stops working, we will implement an emergency landing feature to the drone to help ensure the drones safety.
Controlled Sensitivity : 2
Controlled Likelihood : 2
Controlled Risk : 4

6.) Non availability of members during certain weekends
Sensitivity: 3
Likelihood: 4
Risk: 12
Control : We have 2 sub teams, one for control of motors and sensors and the other for communication between the base station and drone. These teams consist of 2 team members who should be aware of their sub team member's work in order to establish complete understanding of the sub system and also for the sake of integration. This will allow other members to handle work required in case of absences.
Controlled Sensitivity: 1
Controlled Likelihood: 2
Controlled Risk: 2

7.) The chassis we use could break or deform.
Sensitivity : 4
Likelihood: 2
Risk: 8
Control : We will laser cut an extra set of chassis parts in case one of the parts gets deformed or is completely broken. This allows us to replace parts quickly and easily.
Controlled Sensitivity: 2
Contolled Likelihood: 1
Controlled Risk: 2
