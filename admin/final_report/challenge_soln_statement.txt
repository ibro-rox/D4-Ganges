Challenge Solution statement

Same-day parcel delivery is a difficult proposition for many businesses, even those that restrict the service to large cities. The current solution of couriers using vans and motorcycles is inefficient due to congestion in built up areas, especially if the deliveries are spread out across a delivery district. To improve efficiency of small parcel deliveries, Team Ganges proudly presents its Project Itchen prototype â€“ a UAV designed from the ground up for cargo transport. By opening the skies to Itchen for its deliveries, same-day delivery will no longer be restricted to cities and become a reality for customers across the country. 

Many commercially available UAVs exist on the market already, however the key thing holding them back from adoption in the deliveries market is the question of cargo. Taking camera drones as the most common type of payload carrying drone, it can be seen that the payload is securely affixed to the drone chassis. This is excellent for flying around, but is less than optimal for when the package is delivered, as the recipient would have to approach the live UAV to remove the package. To solve this challenge, Team Ganges will provide a mechanism to drop off the package once it has reached its destination and is at a low enough altitude. This will reduce the turn-around time of the drone and allow it to drop off packages when the recipient is not present at the drop-off.

The solution concept also addresses the problem of interference with other transmitters, through avoiding the use of a commercial transmitter in favour of a custom solution. This allows for the communications between the UAV and the Base Station to be encrypted, and the UAV identify true instructions from the base station over interference from other users and devices.
